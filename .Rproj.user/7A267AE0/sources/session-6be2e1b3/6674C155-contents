I received my Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Ghana Medical School in 2018 and have been practicing as a physician for the past four years. During my time as a student, I was deeply committed to advocacy, activism, and held several influential leadership positions. I served as President of the University of Ghana Medical Students’ Association, was an executive committee member of the University of Ghana Students’ Representative Council, and contributed as a member of the national executive committee of the Federation of Ghana Medical Students’ Association.

Post-graduation, my medical journey began at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, followed by my tenure at Cape Coast Teaching Hospital. Most recently, I served as Clinical Coordinator at Abrafi Women and Children’s Hospital. In this role, I spearheaded initiatives to enhance patient satisfaction, increase patient attendance, and introduce new clinical services. I organized community medical outreaches and acted as a liaison with the Ghana Health Service Regional Directorate, striving to strengthen healthcare delivery. Throughout my career, I have participated in numerous workshops and conferences, earning certifications in critical areas such as Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Reproductive Health, Emergency Medicine, and Healthcare Financing. My passion for service extended beyond hospital walls, as I have volunteered in medical outreaches to underserved communities and engaged in numerous public health education and promotion campaigns.

Currently, I am in my second year of the dual MPH/MBA program at Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School and Bloomberg School of Public Health, specializing in Data Science and Business Analytics. My passion for health data science is rooted in its transformative potential to enhance healthcare delivery. I aim to harness the power of data-driven insights to optimize patient outcomes, improve healthcare efficiency, and make care more personalized and evidence-based. By bridging data science and business acumen, I am committed to creating innovative solutions that drive impactful change in health systems and elevate public health standards.
