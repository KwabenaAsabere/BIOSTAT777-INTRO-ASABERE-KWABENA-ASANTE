The Coronary Risk-Factor Study (CORIS) was a comprehensive 
baseline survey that assessed cardiovascular risk factors in 
three rural communities in the Western Cape, South Africa [@rossouw1983coris]. 
Subsequent studies have highlighted community-based interventions and their
effectiveness in reducing risk factors over time [@rossouw1993intervention]. 
Long-term results of CORIS demonstrate sustained benefits and provide valuable 
insights for public health strategies [@steyn1997twelve].
