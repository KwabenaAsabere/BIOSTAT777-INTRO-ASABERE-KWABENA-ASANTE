    "text": "I received my Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Ghana Medical School in 2018 and have been practicing as a physician for the past four years. During my time as a student, I was deeply committed to advocacy, activism, and held several influential leadership positions. I served as President of the University of Ghana Medical Students’ Association, was an executive committee member of the University of Ghana Students’ Representative Council, and contributed as a member of the national executive committee of the Federation of Ghana Medical Students’ Association.\nPost-graduation, my medical journey began at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, followed by my tenure at Cape Coast Teaching Hospital. Most recently, I served as Clinical Coordinator at Abrafi Women and Children’s Hospital. In this role, I spearheaded initiatives to enhance patient satisfaction, increase patient attendance, and introduce new clinical services. I organized community medical outreaches and acted as a liaison with the Ghana Health Service Regional Directorate, striving to strengthen healthcare delivery. Throughout my career, I have participated in numerous workshops and conferences, earning certifications in critical areas such as Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Reproductive Health, Emergency Medicine, and Healthcare Financing. My passion for service extended beyond hospital walls, as I have volunteered in medical outreaches to underserved communities and engaged in numerous public health education and promotion campaigns.\nCurrently, I am in my second year of the dual MPH/MBA program at Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School and Bloomberg School of Public Health, specializing in Data Science and Business Analytics. My passion for health data science is rooted in its transformative potential to enhance healthcare delivery. I aim to harness the power of data-driven insights to optimize patient outcomes, improve healthcare efficiency, and make care more personalized and evidence-based. By bridging data science and business acumen, I am committed to creating innovative solutions that drive impactful change in health systems and elevate public health standards."

    "text": "Analysis Question:\nThe analysis aims to answer the question: “How do specific risk factors, such as age, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and blood pressure, influence the likelihood of myocardial infarction (MI) among white males aged 15 to 64 in high-incidence rural areas of the Western Cape, South Africa?” (Steyn et al. 1997)This logistic regression analysis will quantify and evaluate the strength of association between these risk factors and the presence of MI, helping to shed light on their contributions to cardiovascular health outcomes.(Rossouw et al. 1993)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Population\n\n\n\nThe study population lacks diversity as it involves only white men.No women or people of colour were included in the study so the results of this analysis may not be generisable.\n\n\n\n\nIntended Audience:\nThe intended audience for this data analysis includes:\n\nHealthcare professionals seeking to understand and address cardiovascular disease risk factors in rural populations.\nPublic health policymakers focused on designing targeted interventions for high-risk communities.\nMedical researchers interested in the statistical relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and disease outcomes.\nStudents and educators in the fields of public health, epidemiology, and data science who can use this analysis as a case study for practical applications of logistic regression.\n\n\n\nSource of Data:\nThe data analyzed in this project is derived from the Coronary Risk-Factor Study (CORIS),(Rossouw et al. 1983) a baseline survey conducted in three rural areas of the Western Cape, South Africa, as reported by Rousseauw et al. (1983). This study specifically assessed risk factors for ischemic heart disease among white males aged 15 to 64.

Age (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, p &lt; 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.33, p = 0.002) were found to be significant predictors, indicating that an increase in these factors was associated with a higher likelihood of MI. A positive family history of heart disease was also a strong predictor (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.69-4.13, p &lt; 0.001). Blood pressure categories and smoking status did not show statistically significant associations.\nThe model demonstrated good discriminative ability, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.7889. These findings underscore the importance of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol management and the relevance of family history in predicting MI risk, emphasizing the need for targeted preventive strategies in this population.\n\n\nThe significant associations of age, LDL cholesterol, and family history with myocardial infarction highlight key risk factors requiring intervention, while the lack of significance for blood pressure categories and smoking status suggests potential complexities in their impact or limitations in sample representation.\n\n\n\nlist of packages and functions used\n\ndplyr a)mutate b)case when\nggplot a)geom_point b)geom_histogram c)geom_scatterplot d)facet-wrap\ntidyr 1) rename , relocate,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nRossouw, JE, JP Du Plessis, AJ Benadé, PC Jordaan, JP Kotzé, PL Jooste, and JJ Ferreira. 1983. “Coronary Risk Factor Screening in Three Rural Communities.
